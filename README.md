# Export Exchange Mailbox Delegation Permissions

## Overview
This PowerShell script helps **Exchange administrators** retrieve and export **Full Access, Send As, and Send on Behalf** permissions for all **user and shared mailboxes** in Exchange Online. The data is saved in a CSV file, making it easy to review and audit mailbox delegation settings.

This script is useful for IT teams managing Exchange Online as it provides a clear overview of who has access to which mailboxes, ensuring security and compliance.

## Key Features
- âœ… **Automates the process** of retrieving mailbox permissions.
- âœ… **Exports data** to a CSV file (`C:\DelegationAccessSummary.csv`).
- âœ… **Supports both user and shared mailboxes**.
- âœ… **Uses a secure connection** to Exchange Online.
- âœ… **Disconnects automatically** after execution to avoid unnecessary sessions.

## Why Use This Script?
ðŸ”¹ **Simplifies administration** by providing a quick summary of mailbox delegation.  
ðŸ”¹ **Helps IT teams** efficiently manage mailbox access in Exchange Online.  
ðŸ”¹ **Supports security audits** and ensures compliance with organizational policies.  
ðŸ”¹ **Reduces manual effort** and human error in permission tracking.  

## How It Works
1. The script **connects securely** to Exchange Online.
2. It retrieves all **user and shared mailboxes**.
3. The script checks and records:
   - **Full Access permissions** (who can fully control the mailbox)
   - **Send As permissions** (who can send emails as the mailbox owner)
   - **Send on Behalf permissions** (who can send emails on behalf of the mailbox owner)
4. The collected data is **saved into a structured CSV file**.
5. The script **disconnects** from Exchange Online to close the session securely.
